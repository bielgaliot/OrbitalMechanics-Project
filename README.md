# OrbitalMechanics-Project
Preliminary design of the trajectory for an interplanetary mission between Earth and Saturn with a Jupiter gravity assist.


C++ is used for mission time calculations and Python is used find a numerical solution to the equations using bolazno's theorem. Python is also used to make the representations of the different orbital insertion paths depending on the true anomaly at the moment of insertion.
